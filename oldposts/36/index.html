  <p>Pretty much work during the day. This evening we went out to Ravi's neigborhood, Palm Meadows, which is the kind of a walled community that you'd see in San Jose. We went to dinner at the country club, which has two restauraunts in it. We ate outside. It was remarkably like being in San Jose, except there were a lot more germans than in San Jose (SAP has a huge facility about a mile away)</p>
