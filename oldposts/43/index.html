  <p>Well, a quick week in Bangalore. Lots of work stuff. I'm in Singapore now, waiting for my San Francisco flight.</p>
<p>Not much to highlight for the week, just a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Had lunch at Samarkand. But it was set up like a &ldquo;northern borders&rdquo; interior. The cups were wrought copper. We had some wonderful kabobs, best I've ever had. Ravi said the wait in the evening for dinner can be up to three hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Had Sunday brunch with a friend from the US at the <a href="http://www.theleela.com/bangalore/bangalore_hotel.htm">Leela Hotel</a>. This was definitely a side of Bangalore I had not seen. The Leela is a five star hotel with rooms around $500 a night. Inside is modeled after some temples in Mysore, but it is a new hotel. Inside is 6 acres of gardens and courtyards. Quite impressive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the wildlife department, in addition to the ever-present cows and oxen, I saw a group of donkeys by the side of the road, sleeping back to back. They weren't pulling carts or anything, they were just sleeping.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for now. Off to take my 20 hour flight to San Francisco now.</p>
