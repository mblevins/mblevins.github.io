  <p>In the summer of 2011, Lola and I went on a Kayak trip in BC, this is one of the &ldquo;camps&rdquo; we stayed at. You can read about the rest of the trip <a href="http://02ccd16.netsolhost.com/wp1/?p=613" title="2011 BC Kayak">here</a>. Here's some pictures about the first &ldquo;camp&rdquo; we visited, <a href="http://www.solstuawest.com/">Solstua West</a>. This was hands-down the fanciest &ldquo;camp&rdquo; I've ever been at. There were four tent sites, so up to eight people could stay at a time. I think Kayaking was probably the most popular activity, but it could also be used for general retreats, etc. You could have a nice visit just hanging out there!</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430936648_qtNt77J-A-LB" title="IMG_0953"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-qtNt77J/0/S/IMG0953-S.jpg" alt="IMG_0953" title="IMG_0953"></a></p>
<p>That's our cabin down there. It was on a wood platform with a roof over the tent and a little porch in front. I didn't get a shot of the full bed inside the tent, but you can find a picture on their web site.   </p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430945995_dbHHSjK-A-LB" title="IMG_0986"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-dbHHSjK/0/S/IMG0986-S.jpg" alt="IMG_0986" title="IMG_0986"></a></p>
<p>Walking towards the bluff cabin. That's past the tents at the end of the trail.</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430948059_bmKmnmx-A-LB" title="IMG_0989"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-bmKmnmx/0/S/IMG0989-S.jpg" alt="IMG_0989" title="IMG_0989"></a></p>
<p>Chairs outside the bluff cabin.</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430949151_GxsZs64-A-LB" title="IMG_0991"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-GxsZs64/0/S/IMG0991-S.jpg" alt="IMG_0991" title="IMG_0991"></a></p>
<p>Inside the bluff cabin. It really is just a small one room cabin for guests to hang out in. It was sunny when we were there, so I don't think anyone ever used it, but would be sure nice if it was raining.</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430950668_mpWRcTq-A-LB" title="IMG_0992"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-mpWRcTq/0/S/IMG0992-S.jpg" alt="IMG_0992" title="IMG_0992"></a></p>
<p>This is the coffee station. You just walk down in the morning, crank up the coleman stove and grab one of the french presses they have in the cubbies.</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430952401_TbKc4mf-A-LB" title="IMG_0993"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-TbKc4mf/0/S/IMG0993-S.jpg" alt="IMG_0993" title="IMG_0993"></a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;facilities&rdquo;. They were pretty high tech composting toilets, with fans &amp; heaters (similar to one we have outside at our house, but nicer).</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430954029_zPrqsV3-A-LB" title="IMG_0994"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-zPrqsV3/0/S/IMG0994-S.jpg" alt="IMG_0994" title="IMG_0994"></a></p>
<p>Showers. They actually had individual showers for each cabin with a changing room for each shower. They had an on-demand hot water heater.</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430957956_WbHX8ck-A-LB" title="IMG_1001"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-WbHX8ck/0/S/IMG1001-S.jpg" alt="IMG_1001" title="IMG_1001"></a></p>
<p>Trail from the cabins down to the dock.</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430959603_XdmtHNC-A-LB" title="IMG_1002"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-XdmtHNC/0/S/IMG1002-S.jpg" alt="IMG_1002" title="IMG_1002"></a></p>
<p>Just a storage shed down by the dock, but some nice flowers hanging there.</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430961777_kMMc6z5-A-LB" title="IMG_1007"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-kMMc6z5/0/S/IMG1007-S.jpg" alt="IMG_1007" title="IMG_1007"></a></p>
<p>Garden in the back of Susan and Pete's house.</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430963351_NVtBFz5-A-LB" title="IMG_1008"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-NVtBFz5/0/S/IMG1008-S.jpg" alt="IMG_1008" title="IMG_1008"></a></p>
<p>Susan and Pete's saw mill. That seems to be the big thing on the islands, having your own saw mill, as otherwise you have to bring in lumber by boat.</p>
<p><a href="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/18535909_m3RB8M#1430927431_LKstVjD-A-LB" title="IMG_0928"><img src="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Travel/bckayak2011/i-LKstVjD/0/S/IMG0928-S.jpg" alt="IMG_0928" title="IMG_0928"></a></p>
<p>This is a duplicate picture from our trip pictures, but it shows the dinner table down by the dock.</p>
